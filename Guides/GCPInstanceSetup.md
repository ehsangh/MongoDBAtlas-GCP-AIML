* In the top box, search for "Credentials" and choose the auto-complete option 

* In the search field up top, enter “compute engine” and select the suggestion: "Credentials APIs & Services"

* Click the blue "Create credentials" then choose "Service account key" in the list 

* Choose "new service account" and give it a name like atlasgcpdemo. For the scope, choose *what should i choose here?* and JSON format. Save and it will download the JSON file. Keep these contents for later.

* Go back to the Compute Engine page to list all VM instances.

* Run the following commands:

```
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
  sudo apt-get install -y git
  git clone https://github.com/graboskyc/MongoDBAtlas-GCP-AIML.git
  cd MongoDBAtlas-GCP-AIML/FinishedSampleCode
  python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Edit the `gcpcreds.json` to have the credentials of the json file you downloaded above
* Edit `settings.cfg` to have the Atlas connection string created above
* Run `python3 runner.py` to start the application
* Visit the URL of your server port 8088 and you should see a web page
  * e.g. if the public IP address of your Google Cloud instance is 12.23.45.56, open a browser and visit http://12.23.45.56:8088
